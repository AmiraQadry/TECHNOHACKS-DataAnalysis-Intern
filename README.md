# Titanic Data Analysis

This repo provides an example of performing data analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python and PowerBI. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their cabin class, fare, and survival status.

## Requirements

To run the code and perform the data analysis, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Power BI Desktop

## Code Overview

The repo contains the following files:

- `titanic.csv`: The Titanic dataset in CSV format.
- `Titanic Data Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for data analysis.
- `titanic.pbix"`: Data analysis Dashboard with Power Bi.
- `README.md`: Readme file explaining the repository.

The `titanic_analysis.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform data analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python. It covers the following aspects:

1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tasks such as data visualization, summary statistics, and missing value analysis
3. Data preprocessing, including filling missing values and feature engineering
4. Modeling using logistic regression
5. Evaluation of the model's performance
6. Create a data analysis dashboard with Power Bi
